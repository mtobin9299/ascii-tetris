In order to run the game, simply run "make".

If the game doesn't launch and throws a fatal exception, it is
most likely your terminal size. Simply make your terminal larger
and it should work. On the other hand, if your game is really
laggy and has low (0-20 fps), try making your terminal a bit smaller.
Bringing the terminal as tight to the board while still giving enough
room to run gives the best results.

Note, if you do not use q to quit the game (but rather ctrl c), 
there will be side effects in your terminal such as hidden text
and cursor.
